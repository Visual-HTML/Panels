Working in VSTS allow only an import/export workflow senario.  I don't work on cloned repository, this workflow 
allow remote repository workflow but it isn't available in VSTS, so I can ask a pull request to GitHub when needed.

speak about version control (manage and store versions of one or several files)

the better you know Git at command-line the better you manage it on other user-interfaces
(the full doumentation of Git is at https://git-scm.com/docs, but the content of the online video make it effective
to work on Git, GitHub and all interfaces to Git presented in the course)

35 millions GitHub repositories, 14 millions users

Collaborate, contribute, open-source, it is file storage in essence so you can document/code/project anything

More than code files and programmimg matter, issues in GitHub can be used to define objectives/targets/realisations



GitHub is distributed version control
Cloning : get the entire repository from the mainstream repository
Branch : you create a branch to work on a new feature,
         this let place to a conversation before merging what is proposed in that branch
         using the command-line when you branch your file system path remain in 
         the context of the branch (a file/folder can exist or not)
GitHub bring a lot of collaboration entities on Git : issues, projects, wiki, pages,... they all come enrich the base
version control system provided by Git
GitHub provide a private repository option (it is charged, Gist is also free/public)



Heroku allow to update from GitHub
Pull requests are GitHub entity



GitHub Workflow : https://guides.github.com - https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
branching: without, you will always beeing working on the master branch, 
you can clone a repository not only on master branch but on other branches...
branches, commits, open pull request, discussions and new commits, deploy, merge
Merge conflicts are to be defined by human : what code will take place to the pulled branch



open-source: source available publicly, you get the whole code in a usable form unless
you have machines, compiler, runtime, software needed to make it run... so any html/js/css code found on GitHub has good
chance to work on your browser (using GitHub pages, I can switch from repository view to runtime/rendering view)
With GitHub pages you can mix websites and then lead to repository where you have structure something adapted 
to collaboration
Sense of collaboation are sevral in building project and its methodology



GitHub, the browser version- no tooling, no client, no command-line, full graphical web interface
